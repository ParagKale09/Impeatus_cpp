Accept product rate and quantity purchased and calculate the gross and net bill amount
Gross bill amount = quantity purchased X product rate
Net Bill amount = Gross bill amount - discount
Discount is 5 % of Gross bill amount if the quantity purchased is more than 100 units
If the quantity purchased is less than or equal to 100 units then the discount
